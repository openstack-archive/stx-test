Test BMC functionality (host-reset; power-on;power-off) - requires BMC network on management VLAN

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BMC must be configured with its statick IP address, using BMC tools. BMC should be reachable from controllers.

~~~~~~~~~~
Test Steps

   a) Login to platform Horizon
   b) Go to Admin / Platform / Host Inventory, "Hosts" tab
   c) click on "Edit host", then Board Management, and fill it out with the BMC info.

2. Verify Power  off / on works as expected
   a) Lock controller-1
   system host-lock controller-1
   b) turn it down
   system host-power-off controller-1
   c) Wait until it's off
   d) turn it up
   system host-power-on controller-1

3. Verify reset works
   a) send the reset signal
   system host-reset controller-1
   b) wait until it becomes 'online'

4. Unlock the controller
   system host-unlock controller-1


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. BMC is configured and reachable from controller-0

2. node powers off, then on 

3. Node reboots

   Check alarms are raised and cleared as expected
