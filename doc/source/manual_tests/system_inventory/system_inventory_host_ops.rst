~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Testcase Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Test BMC functionality (host-reset; power-on;power-off) - requires BMC network on management VLAN

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BMC must be configured with its statick IP address, using BMC tools. BMC should be reachable from controllers.

~~~~~~~~~~
Test Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Configure BMC on controller-1 (assuming is the stand-by controller)

1.1. Login to platform Horizon

1.2. Go to Admin / Platform / Host Inventory, "Hosts" tab

1.3. click on "Edit host", then Board Management, and fill it out with the BMC info.

2. Verify Power  off / on works as expected

2.1. Lock controller-1

.. code:: bash

  system host-lock controller-1

2.2. turn it down

.. code:: bash

   system host-power-off controller-1

2.3. Wait until it's off

2.4. turn it up

.. code:: bash

  system host-power-on controller-1

3. Verify reset works

3.1 Send the reset signal

.. code:: bash

  system host-reset controller-1

3.2. wait until it becomes 'online'

4. Unlock the controller

.. code:: bash

  system host-unlock controller-1


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. BMC is configured and reachable from controller-0

2. node powers off, then on

3. Node reboots

   Check alarms are raised and cleared as expected
