:Test ID: sysinv_inst_01
:Test Title: Install with with dynamic IP addressing
:Tags: sysinv

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Testcase Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install using dynamic IPs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

N/A

~~~~~~~~~~
Test Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install controller-0, configure it with system configuration file, using DYNAMIC_ALLOCATION IP addressing

2. Bring up controller-1:
   a) Verify the DHCP discover FM log occurs as expected on host discovery
   b) Verify that Mgmt. interface FM alarms are raised and cleared as expected
   c) Check the mgmt IP addresses assigned are in expected range (as specified in /etc/dnsmasq.conf)

3. Bring up the system and check the system functioning as expected

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. the active controller is up and all services are running

2. DHCP discover FM log occurs as expected on host discovery
   - mgmt. or infra. interface FM alarms are raised and cleared as expected
   - mgmt. and infra. IP addresses assigned are in expected range

3. Config is up and running

:Test ID: sysinv_inst_02
:Test Title: Install with with static addressing and pxeboot
:Tags: sysinv

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Testcase Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install using static IPs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

N/A

~~~~~~~~~~
Test Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Install controller-0, configure it with system configuration file with STATIC_ALLOCATION IP addressing and pxeboot

2. Bring up controller-1
   a) Add the host to the inventory
   system host-add -n controller-1 -p controller -i <mgmt_ip>
   b) power on the node and configure it after install finishes


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. active controller is up and all servers are running

2.  mgmt. interface FM alarms are raised and cleared as expected
- static IPs in mgmt. range are accepted when update the personality of the node

:Test ID: sysinv_inst_03
:Test Title: Reinstall a node on a dynamic addressing system
:Tags: sysinv

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Testcase Objective
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reinstalling a node using dynamic IPs

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Pre-Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A configuration already working, using dynamic IPs

~~~~~~~~~~
Test Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

1. Lock the host to be reinstalled - worker-1 in this case
   system host-lock worker-1

2. Delete the host from inventory
   system host-delete worker-1

3. Power off the host

4. Power it on (make sure it boots from management NIC)

5. Configure the node personality
   system host-update <id> personality=worker hostname=worker-1

6. Allow the node to be installed and proceed to configure it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Expected Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. node gest locked

2. node doesn't show up in host-list

5. node with worker personallity assigned

6. node working in the config
